# About DODO

DODO is a decentralized exchange platform powered by the Proactive Market Maker (PMM) algorithm. It features highly capital-efficient liquidity pools that support single-token provision, reduce impermanent loss, and minimize slippage for traders. The trading platform also offers SmartTrade, a decentralized liquidity aggregation service that routes to and compares various liquidity sources to quote the optimal swap rate between any two tokens.

DODORouteProxy is a new routeProxy contract with fee rebate to manage all route. It provides three methods to swap, including mixSwap,multiSwap and externalSwap. Mixswap is for linear swap, which describes one token path with one pool each time. Multiswap is a simplified version about 1inch, which describes one token path with several pools each time. ExternalSwap is for other routers like 0x, 1inch and paraswap. Dodo and front-end users could take certain route fee rebate from each swap. Wherein dodo will get a fixed percentage, and front-end users could assign any proportion through function parameters. 

# Test

Inheritaged a template using Foundry && HardHat architecture.
All tests base on hardhat.

## Motivation

With this new architecture, we can get:

- Unit tests written in solidity
- Foundry's cast
- Integration testing with Hardhat
- Hardhat deploy & verify
- Typescript

### Hardhat

Hardhat is an Ethereum development environment for professionals. It facilitates performing frequent tasks, such as running tests, automatically checking code for mistakes or interacting with a smart contract.

On [Hardhat's website](https://hardhat.org) you will find:

- [Guides to get started](https://hardhat.org/getting-started/)
- [Hardhat Network](https://hardhat.org/hardhat-network/)
- [Plugin list](https://hardhat.org/plugins/)
